    "### GPT 3.5 Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we run the GPT 3.5 Turbo model hosted by OpenAI via our own Google Cloud Function to evaluate its performance in outputing General and Temporal labels on the same test-set of 1287 claim and evidence pairs that was used for the LSTM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have used the text-davinci completions model available by OpenAI. However, cost was prohibitive and we relied on the GPT 3.5 Turbo model that is 1/10 the cost of Da-Vinci, but requires some serious prompt engineering to fine-tune.\n",
    "\n",

    "| **text-davinci-003**  | **USD 0.02** / 1K tokens  |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the 1287 claim and evidence pairs that we used, gpt-3.5 would have cost us 2.574 USD while text-davinci-003 would have been 10 times more at 25.74 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prompt that was used is reflected below:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a claim and evidence sentence, each of which is a string of text. Perform text classification to determine whether the evidence might support, refute, or not have enough information on the claim. Ignore irrelevant elements of the evidence. Please return the following information in JSON format: \n",
    "* SAME_ENTITY_LABEL: A boolean value indicating whether the main subject of the claim and evidence refer to the same entity. An entity can be a person, place, or thing. If the claim and evidence refer to the same entity, even if there are coreferences that make it unclear, the SAME_ENTITY_LABEL should be true.\n",
    "* SAME_ENTITY_JUSTIFICATION: A brief justification for your SAME_ENTITY_LABEL. * GENERAL_FACTS_LABEL: Either \"SUPPORTS\", \"REFUTES\", or \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\" indicating whether the the non-temporal information in the evidence supports, refutes, or has not enough information to address the claim.\n",
    "*GENERAL_FACTS_JUSTIFICATION: An explanation of which part of the evidence supports, refutes, or provides insufficient information for the claim in terms of non-temporal information. If the evidence does not address all aspects of the claim, mention that fact and provide an explanation for why the evidence is insufficient.\n",
    "* TIME_LABEL: Either 'SUPPORTS', 'REFUTES', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO' indicating whether the date or time information in the evidence matches the date or time stated in the claim, ignoring general facts.\n",
    "* TIME_JUSTIFICATION: An explanation for the TIME_LABEL decision based on the date or time information present in the evidence and claim. \n",
    "* TOPIC: The most likely topic that the claim and evidence is referring to. If the claim and evidence are referring to entirely different topics, then return both topics separately."
